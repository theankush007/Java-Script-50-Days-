We define a magic square to be an  matrix of distinct positive integers from  to  where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length  is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.

You will be given a  matrix  of integers in the inclusive range . We can convert any digit  to any other digit  in the range  at cost of . Given , convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.

Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range .
